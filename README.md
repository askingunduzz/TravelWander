# TravelWander

We created a Java application as part of our Database Management Systems Course, focusing on travel to Turkey. The app connects to a MySQL database and offers various features to enhance the user's experience.

Firstly, users can save their personal information in the database. They can then easily update or delete their stored information whenever needed. The application also allows users to view their personal details whenever they want.

In addition to managing personal information, the application allows users to explore different cities in Turkey. They can choose from six cities: Ankara, Istanbul, Bursa, Izmir, Konya, and Antalya. Once a city is selected, users can learn about various aspects such as Places to Visit, Activities, Foods, Famous People, and Interesting Facts associated with that city.

Our project demonstrates the seamless integration of data from the MySQL database that we carefully constructed. All information, including city names, photos, engaging content, and other relevant details, is dynamically retrieved from the database. This dynamic approach ensures that our application stays up-to-date and easily customizable, providing users with an immersive experience.

We spent a month developing this project and enjoyed gaining extensive knowledge throughout the process.



We made a trailer video for our app. You can watch it from down below.
