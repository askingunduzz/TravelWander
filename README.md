We made this project for our Database Management Systems Course. This Java app is connected to MySQL.
The purpose of this Java application is to cater to clients interested in traveling to Turkey. The application offers several functionalities to enhance the user experience. Firstly, users can save their personal information to the database. Subsequently, they have the flexibility to update or delete their stored information. Additionally, users can view their personal details whenever desired.
Beyond managing personal information, the application enables users to explore the captivating cities of Turkey. Six cities are available for selection: Ankara, Istanbul, Bursa, Izmir, Konya, and Antalya. Once a city is chosen, users can delve into various aspects, such as Places to Visit, Various Activities, Foods, Famous People, and Interesting Facts associated with the selected city.

Our project showcases a seamless integration of data from the MySQL database that we meticulously constructed. Every aspect, including city names, corresponding photos, captivating content, and other relevant details, is dynamically retrieved from the database. This dynamic approach ensures that our application remains up-to-date and easily customizable, providing users with a truly immersive experience.

We dedicated a month to develop this project, during which we gained extensive knowledge and had an enjoyable experience throughout the process.
